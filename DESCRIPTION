Description: The Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)

  that drive childhood cancers. Investigators form a collaborative network to facilitate 
  discovery of molecular targets and translate those findings into the clinic. TARGET is 
  managed by NCIâ€™s Office of Cancer Genomics and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.
